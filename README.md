# Double-Pendulum-Control
This repository contains the implementation of **Linear Quadratic Requlator (LQR)** and **Convex Model Predictive Control (MPC)** for stabilizing a **double pendulum system**. The [project](https://github.com/ChouliarasVasileios/Double-Pendulum-Control/blob/main/ECEUoP_RS_2_HW_2.pdf) was developed as part of the **Robotics System II course**, supervised by **Assistant Professor Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis.**

# Project Overview
The aim of this assignment was to:

- Formulate the **dynamics of double pendulum system**.

- Apply **linear control techniques (LQR and MPC)** to a **non-linear system.**

- Demostrate how **linear approximations** can effectively control complex system.

The double pendulum is a classic example of a non-linear system known for it's chaotic behavior. By applying linear control methods, this project showcases how such system can still be approximated and controlled within certain operating regions.
